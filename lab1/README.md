# Lab 1 Overview

In this lab, learn how to use Dynatrace features that support Performance testing for each phase: scripting, analysis, and reporting.

We will use the same demo application from the previous lab and use a simple unix shell script to automate load.

## Tag Tests with HTTP headers

While executing a load test from your load testing tool of choice (JMeter, Neotys, LoadRunner, etc) each simulated HTTP request can be tagged with additional HTTP headers that contain test-transaction information (for example, script name, test step name, and virtual user ID). Dynatrace can analyze incoming HTTP headers and extract such contextual information from the header values and tag the captured requests with request attributes. Request attributes enable you to filter your monitoring data based on defined tags.

You can use any (or multiple) HTTP headers or HTTP parameters to pass context information. The extraction rules can be configured via Settings > Server-side service monitoring > Request attributes.

The header ```x-dynatrace-test``` is used one or more key/value pairs for the header.  Here are some examples:

|Key|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|VU|Virtual User ID of the unique user who sent the request.|
|SI|Source ID identifies the product that triggered the request (JMeter, LoadRunner, Neotys, or other)|
|TSN|Test Step Name is a logical test step within your load testing script (for example, Login or Add to cart.|
|LSN|Load Script Name - name of the load testing script. This groups a set of test steps that make up a multi-step transaction (for example, an online purchase).|
|LTN|The Load Test Name uniquely identifies a test execution (for example, 6h Load Test â€“ June 25)|
|PC|Page Context provides information about the document that is loaded in the currently processed page.|

### Exercise Steps

1. Review the simple shell script 

    ```
    cd ~/hotday/lab3
    more catalog_loadtest.sh
    ```
    This script calls three Order service URLS:
    * open search page: ```/catalog/searchForm.html```
    * perform a search: ```/catalog/searchByName.html```
    * view item detail: ```/catalog/1.html```

    Notice how the each request adds in ```x-dynatrace-test``` header using several keys/pairs for LSN, LTN, and TSN.

        ```
        curl -s "$url/catalog/searchForm.html" -w "%{http_code}" -H "x-dynatrace-test: LSN=$loadScriptName;LTN=$loadTestName;TSN=$testStepName;" -o /dev/nul
        ```

1. In Dynatrace on the left menu, navigate to ```settings --> server-side monitoring --> request attributes```

1. Click ```define a new request attribute``` button and type in the name ```LTN``` and leave the default values

1. Configure the request attribute according to this picture:

    <img src="images/request-attribute.png"/>

    1. Click ```add a new data source``` button and configure as shown below.
    1. ensure ```HTTP request header``` is selected
    1. Fill in the value ```x-dynatrace-test``` for parameter name 
    1. Expand the ```Further restrict or process captured parameters (optional)``` section 
    1. fill in the ```1. Preprocess parameter by extracting substring``` value of ```LSN```
    1. To verify, paste in this values and click the ```preview processed output``` button to verify. 
        ```
        x-dynatrace-test: LSN=MyloadScriptName;LTN=MyLoadTestName;TSN=MytestStepName;
        ```
        <img src="images/request-attribute-verify.png" width="400"/>

1. Save the request attribute rule. 

1. Now repeat the above steps for two more request attributes.  

    |Request attributes Name|Description|Preprocessing parameter|
    |-----|-----------|----|
    |LTN|Load Test Name|LTN=|
    |LSN|Load Step Name|LSN=|
    |TSN|Test Script Name|TSN=|

    At the end you should have three.

    <img src="images/request-attribute-list.png" width="400"/>

1. Run the shell script for 120 seconds 

    ```
    cd ~/hotday/lab3
    ./loadtest.sh 120
    ```

    The output will show the calls along with the HTTP status code.  You should see the HTTP ```200``` code for each call.
    ```
    Load Test Started. DURATION=6 URL=http://[Your IP] THINKTIME=5
    x-dynatrace-test: LSN=order_loadtest.sh;LTN=manual 2019-12-17_14:16:58;
    14:16:58
    calling TSN=CatalogSearchLanding; 200
    calling TSN=CatalogSearch; 200
    calling TSN=CatalogItemView; 200
    ...
    ```

1. Lets checkout Dynatrace and see what happened.  First navigate to ```transactions and services``` and click on the ```order``` service.  On the order service, click on the ```dynamic requests``` button.

    <img src="images/dynamic-requests.png" width="400"/>

1. Now click on the ```request attributes``` button and and review the requests with the names that are defined in the load test.

## Add Request Naming rules

Within Dynatrace, you can use request naming rules to adjust how your requests are tracked and to define business transactions in your customer-facing workflow that are critical to the success of your digital business. With such end-to-end tracing, Dynatrace enables you to view and monitor important business transactions from end to end.

For the demo catalog service, each request URL to view a catalog item has the format ```##.html``` where the number is the product number, so we are going to define a naming rule so that all these request are just called 'product detail.

### Exercise Steps

1. To add a naming rule, click on the ```web request naming rule``` button

    <img src="images/edit-request-names.png" width="400"/>

    NOTE: You can also get to rules at the top of the services page and choosing the ```edit``` option as shown below.

    <img src="images/edit-catalog.png" width="400"/>

1. Within in the service settings, navigate to ```Web request naming``` and click the ```Add rule``` button.

    <img src="images/catalog-naming-rule.png" width="500"/>

1. Configure the rule according to this picture:

    <img src="images/add-rule.png" width="400"/>

    1. Fill in the value ```Item Detail``` for naming patter 
    1. Choose ```URL Path``` and ```contains regex``` with the value ```/\d+.html```
    1. To verify, click the ```preview processed output``` button to verify

1. Save the rule

1. The change will not update past requests, so we need to load script again so that the rule gets applied

    ```
    cd ~/hotday/lab3
    ./loadtest.sh 600
    ```
1. Now we can navigate back the service and click the ```view dynamic requests```

    <img src="images/catalog-view-requests.png" width="500"/>

1. Review the change for the requests.  You may still see the old requests without the new name.

    <img src="images/catalog-requests-after.png" width="400"/>

    Click on the name to make it filtered with the time-series chart.

    By using request attributes in combination with naming rules, you can capture even more context around your requests and use this additional detail to slice and dice your monitoring data.
